# Week 4 – Memory and Pointers

Part of CS50x 2024 – Introduction to Computer Science by Harvard University

## Overview
This week dove into memory management in C. We explored pointers, dynamic memory allocation, and how to manipulate memory safely and efficiently.

## Topics Covered
- Pointers and memory addresses
- malloc, free, calloc
- Strings and file I/O
- Memory safety and debugging tools

## Projects
- Filter (less/more)
- Recover

## Key Takeaways
- Learned how to use pointers to reference and modify memory directly.
- Gained practical experience with file reading and image recovery.
- Understood the importance of freeing dynamically allocated memory.

## Challenges
Managing file streams and dealing with byte-level image recovery was new to me. The Recover project helped me deeply understand how file headers and memory blocks work.

## How to Run
gcc file.c -o output
./output
